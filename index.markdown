<!-- # Foundations of Applied Software Engineering for Games workshop (FaSE4Games’24) -->

> A one day workshop held in conjunction with the [37th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering](https://conf.researchr.org/home/ase-2022).

The goals of **ASE4Games** are gathering academic game researchers and commercial game developers and contributing on topics relevant to the emerging and current challenges in Automated Software Engineering for Games. We seek to:

> Bring together the community of software engineers and game engineers in an interactive program that encourages discussion and scholarly debate from interdisciplinary perspectives.

> Identify and explore emerging and new research challenges, costs and benefits for entertainment games, serious games, and gamification in traditional (non-game) applications and activities.

> Generate a new research agenda, identify topics of interest for this community, and how future workshops may explore these topics.

This workshop is structured to be highly interactive, encourage discussion, and appeal to participants from academia and industry. The workshop will feature keynote presentations, short and long paper presentations with discussions, and a social event to build strong, lasting relationships among the participants.
